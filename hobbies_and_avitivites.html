	<p style="font-size:12pt">
		Cricket is the most popular game in Pakistan. It is played between two teams of 11 with various numner overs. You 
		can read more about the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council"> here</a>. We have
		a huge Pakistani Community here at Koc University. Recently, our cricket club has become official cricket team of Koc University
		and I am the President of the cricket club. It is weekly activity and we play every Saturday. We are planning to involve
		more students in the cricket.

	<p style="font-size:12pt">
		They say that the music is food for the soul. I agree with this statement. I have gone a little further and rather than just
		consuming the food, I have started to produce some as well. I am fond of playing the musical instruments. I have learned 
		piano and guiter as of yet and am planning to learn more. Moreover, I write poetry; mostly in Urdu, but sometimes in english as 
		well. You can follow my social media to listen to my master pieces.
